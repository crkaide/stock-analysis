# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Initial analysis was done for the client (Steve) on a dataset that he provided containing stock performance information for the DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ) and its industry competitors.  Information reported for each relevant ticker index includes the stock's performance over the timespan of the provided data as well as total volume traded (as an indicator of demand/investor buy-in).  The conclusion of the initial analysis was that the workbook initially provided was successfuly and accurately reported results, but needed to have its code refactored to allow it to run quickly over larger data sets.  Recoding goals included un-nesting For loops to force the analysis to perform just a single loop through all the data (data set should be arranged in chronological order by Column B "Date" before running the macro/analysis), as well as adding output range formatting to the analysis macro.
